### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emanuel Gustavo Vierne, I'm from Brazil and I live in a small city in the south of this giant country.

I'm a Clarion developer, work in a software house that build a solid ERP for furnitures company. I work with PowerBI, Excel and VBA to manage data and generate reports and dashboards. I'm learning everyday about code, technology, data, statistics and business analysis, and I like how the data can provide to us a lot of information about everything! I'm an automation engineering student too.

**emanuelgustavo/emanuelgustavo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
