### Hi there 👋

I'm Emanuel Gustavo Vierne, I'm from Brazil and I live in a small city on the south of this biggest country.

Actually I work full-time as Costs Analysts in a furniture factory, but all my free time I try to spend learning more about web development.
🌱 I’m currently learning about ReactJS, SPAs, Nextjs, JAMStack and other amazing libraries and frameworks.

I like watch movies, series, play football and video games, play guitar and listening good music!

**emanuelgustavo/emanuelgustavo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
