### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emanuel Gustavo Vierne, I'm from Brazil and I live in a small city in the south of this giant country.

I'm a Clarion developer, work in a software house that build a solid ERP for furnitures company.
I'm learning everyday about code, technology, web-development, data, statistics and business analysis, but now beyond the Clarion, I'm focus on learning web development, specially front-ent with React library and other design tools like Figma.
I like how the tachnology and automation can help us to improve our life! 
I'm an computer engineering student too and I like go for a long walk with my wife, to play Acoustic Guitar and watch movies and Series.

**emanuelgustavo/emanuelgustavo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
