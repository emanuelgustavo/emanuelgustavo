### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emanuel Gustavo Vierne, I'm from Brazil and I live in a small city in the south of this giant country.

I work full-time as Costs Analysts in a furniture factory, but all my free time I try to spend time learning more about web development. seedling Iâ€™m currently learning about ReactJS, SPAs, Nextjs, JAMStack, and other amazing libraries and frameworks.

I like to watch movies, series, travel with my wife, play football and video games, play guitar and listening to good music!

**emanuelgustavo/emanuelgustavo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
