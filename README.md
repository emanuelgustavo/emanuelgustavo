### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emanuel Gustavo Vierne, I'm from Brazil and I live in a small city in the south of this giant country.

I'm a Clarion developer, work in a software house that build a solid ERP for furnitures company.
I'm learning everyday about code, technology, web-development, data, statistics and business analysis.
I use PowerBI, Excel and VBA to manage data and generate reports and dashboards. 
I like how the tachnology and automation can help us to improve our life! 
I'm an computer engineering student too.
